Signal K APRS Plugin
====================

This plugin integrates Signal K with the [Automatic Packet Reporting System](https://www.aprs.org) (APRS), a packet radio system for Radio Amateurs. The plugin connects to various APRS-capable radio systems using the KISS TNC protocol.

You need to be a licensed radio amateur to use APRS. For everybody else, [Signal K Meshtastic Plugin](https://github.com/meri-imperiumi/signalk-meshtastic) is the way to go.
